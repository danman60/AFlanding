    "synopsis":  "Animal Farm: The Musical reimagines Orwell\u0027s classic allegory through an electrifying score and galvanizing staging. After the animals of Manor Farm topple their human oppressors, euphoria splinters into a power struggle that mirrors the rise and fall of revolutions. Genre-blending songs and sharp humor expose the cost of corrupted ideals while celebrating the collective voice that refuses to be silenced.",
